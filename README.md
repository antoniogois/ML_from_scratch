# ML_from_scratch
Some machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python (using only Numpy)

All implementations use the following handwritten digits dataset: http://ai.stanford.edu/~btaskar/ocr. In the case of sequential prediction, each sample is a sequence of digits forming a word (note that each word's first letter has been removed in the original link, to discard upper case, so the words may seem senseless)
