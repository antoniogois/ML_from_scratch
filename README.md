# ML_from_scratch
Machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python (using only Numpy)

All implementations use the following dataset, containing images of handwritten digits: http://ai.stanford.edu/~btaskar/ocr.

In the case of sequential prediction, each sample is a sequence of images forming a word (note that each word's first letter has been removed in the original link, to discard upper case, so the words may seem senseless)
